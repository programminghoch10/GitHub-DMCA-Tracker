# GitHub DMCA Tracker

This repository tracks GitHub DMCA Requests 
in the telegram channel 
[@githubdmcatracker](https://t.me/githubdmcatracker).

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
Every DMCA request has a cooldown of 1 work day 
for the author to delete the infringing content
or GitHub to disable the repository/gist.
If you're notified and handle quickly, 
maybe you can secure yourself some cool proprietary shit.
This idea came to me when 
<a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/06/2022-06-10-voicemeeter.md">my own stuff was taken down</a>.
